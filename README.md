# Terraform-modules
By using modules, we can reuse Terraform code across different projects, eliminating the need to write .tf files from scratch each time.   
Instead, we can define a module block and specify the path to the existing module, which contains the reusable Terraform code.
This approach allows for efficient and consistent infrastructure deployment.
